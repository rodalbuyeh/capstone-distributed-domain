# Tabular Data: State of the Art

## Topics

This week's assignments will contextualize tabular data by:
* Outlining the current state of trends for tabular data. 
* Introducing you to some core algorithms that work well for tabular data.
* Give you some hands on experience doing domain specific, custom feature engineering. 

## Reading

Please read or view the following:
* Article: [2023 Kaggle State of AI Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/reports/kaggle_ai_report_2023.pdf) - specifically the sections on tabular/time-series data and associated notebooks. 
* Kaggle Grandmaster Abishek Thakur's article on [Approaching Almost Any Machine Learning Problem](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/approaching-almost-any-machine-learning-problem-abhishek-thakur/). Do not consider this as THE way to approach tabular data but as one broad approach that can work well.
* Article: [A Gentle Introduction to XGBoost](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-xgboost-applied-machine-learning/)
* Journal Article: [Tabular Data: Deep Learning is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253)

## Tasks 

In our [legacy repository](https://github.com/rodalbuyeh/legacy_code), you will find a link to this [data science challenge](https://github.com/rodalbuyeh/legacy_code/blob/main/Figure%20Data%20Science%20Challenge%202020.pdf): 

* In the following week, follow the instructions to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) model to predict default. While we believe there is "no free lunch" in machine learning, start with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a baseline model and benchmark it against FICO. 
* Prepare one or two slides outlining your approach and results. We will share and discuss these in week 3. 

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:

* Why is feature engineering so important for tabular data? 
* What are the benefits of algorithms like XGBoost? 
* What (if anything) did you learn from Abishek's article that surprised you?
