# Optimization and Modularization in Machine Learning Pipelines

## Topics

In this module, students will deepen their engagement with the machine learning 
development cycle by dividing into specialized teams. This hands-on experience 
will focus on optimizing the machine learning pipeline for efficiency and 
modularity. Students will work collaboratively within their groups to either 
develop generalizable code modules that can be distributed via artifact repositories like  pypi
or enhance the scalability of the existing pipeline for better performance with
large datasets.

### Tasks: 

'Team Pip':

* Identify components in the existing pipeline that can be abstracted into stand-alone modules.
* Create a roadmap for developing these modules with clear milestones and tasks.
* Set up a basic package structure, including 'setup.py', module initialization, and a test suite.

'Team Scalable':

* Profile the current pipeline to identify bottlenecks in data processing and model training.
* Research and propose alternative approaches or technologies that could address these bottlenecks.
* Begin implementing a chosen solution, focusing on distributed computing techniques.

I have also assigned you specific issues in RiskNet. 

### Viewing

* Video: [Profiling Python Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZzb_Wpag_M&pp=ygUWcHJvZmlsaW5nIHB5dGhvbiBjb2RlIA%3D%3D)

### Reading
* [Feature Engineering Book](http://www.feat.engineering) skim chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 


## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on Gradescope:

* What criteria did you use to select components to turn into general modules?
* What performance metrics are most critical when optimizing a machine learning pipeline?
* How does working in a specialized team change your approach to the overall project?

## Deliverables

* 'Team Pip': A Github repository with at least one pip-installable module, documentation, and tests.
* 'Team Scalable': A report on the pipeline bottlenecks identified, proposed solutions, and an implementation plan.
